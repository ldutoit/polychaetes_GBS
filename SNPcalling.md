## 1. Understanding/Exploring the data

The data is paired. To understand the structure, the adaptor content and the barcodes I subset the two big *.gz* files to 25'000 reads.

```
# in source_files/Worms
# mmodule load FastQC
zcat  Worm1_GBS_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz | head -n 100000 > 1_sample.fq
zcat  Worm1_GBS_S1_R2_001.fastq.gz | head -n 100000 > 2_sample.fq
```

Then I check the quality of the sequencing run using fastqc

```
fastqc *fq
```

The output files are [output/1_sample_fastqc.html](output/1_sample_fastqc.html) and [output/2_sample_fastqc.html](output/2_sample_fastqc.html)

Paired-end 2x 75bp. Adapters seem to have been removed, sequence quality is okay. There is a few long polymers.

I try to read demultiplexing on those, to see if it works


```
#from rootfolder
mkdir raw
mkdir samples
mv source_files/Worms/*fq raw
#module load Stacks
process_radtags -P -p raw/ -o ./samples/ -b ~/repos/scripts/polychaetes_GBS/metadata/barcodes.txt -e pstI -r -c -q --inline_inline
```
It seems to work ok:

```

```


NOTE:I was initially worried because of variable barcodes length but [this link](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/stacks-users/BeHrmPoB_Jo) clears it.

It seems to work ok, I'll do a quick FastQC check on the concatenated version of the output:

```
cd samples
rem *rem* # files of discarded reads
cat *1.fq.gz > concat_1.gz
cat *2.fq.gz > concat_2.gz
fastqc concat_1.gz concat_2.gz

```
The output iles are [output/1_sample_fastqc.html](output/1_sample_fastqc.html) and [output/2_sample_fastqc.html](output/2_sample_fastqc.html)

We can see that both reads start with the same barcodes so we can proceed. 
It is single-length, we will be able to proceed forward.
I'll just run a clean on the full dataset removing reads for which the average quality drop below 30 for 10bp.


I now clean this raw/ and sample/ folders.

```
rm raw/* samples/*
```


## 2. Full data

### Demultiplexing (process_radtags)

```
cd raw 
ln -s ../source_files/Worms/*gz .
cd ..

#!/bin/sh
process_radtags -P -p raw/ -o ./samples/ -b ~/repos/scripts/polychaetes_GBS/metadata/barcodes.txt -e pstI -r -c -q --inline_inline -T 8
```

370408774 total sequences
 39463860 barcode not found drops (10.7%)
   269317 low quality read drops (0.1%)
  1229681 RAD cutsite not found drops (0.3%)
329445916 retained reads (88.9%)

Note: I edited the barcode files because there was:

```
ACGACTAG	TTCAGA	1.1.1.4 
GTATT	TCACG	1.1.1.4
```




### Concatenating the output sample by sample

```
cd samples
rm *rem*
rm Empty*
```

then I move them all into the concat folder concatenating forward and reverse together.




```
mkdir concat
cd samples
rm *rem*
rm Empty*
```

Then I used the *dirty*ish [concat.sh] 

### Run denovo_map.pl optimisation



As a single population, on 40 random individuals, I'll check which parameters lead to the most SNPs at 80% according to [Paris et al. 2016](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12775).

I start by creating a popmap of 40 random individuals as a single population. I saved it in:

[metadata/popmap_optimisation.txt]

For M = 2 to M = 8, we want to check which M creates the most amount of SNPs. The loop below creates one runfile for each M and then submit as jobs on the cluster using sbatch
```
#from source folder
for i in 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
do
mkdir -p M$i
echo '#!/bin/sh' > runM$i.sh
echo "denovo_map.pl --samples concat/ --popmap popmap_optimisation.txt  -o M$i -p 0.8 -M $i -n $i -m 3 -T 8"    runM$i.sh
sbatch -A uoo00116 -t 2-00:00:00 -J M$i -c 8 --mem=64G runM$i.sh # specific to mahuika and ludovic.dutoit
done
```
### Run denovo_map.pl full

no big change depending on what we use, run with M = 2.
```
#from source folder
cut -f 3 barcodes.txt | grep -v Empty  | awk '{print $0,"\tsinglepop"}' - > popmap_all.txt
mkdir output_M2
echo '#!/bin/sh' > cleanM2.sh
echo "denovo_map.pl --samples concat/ --popmap popmap_all.txt  -o output_M2  -M 2 -n 2 -m 3 -T 16"  >> cleanM2.sh
sbatch -A uoo00116 -t 10-00:00:00 --partition=long -J cleanM2 -c 16 --mem=64G cleanM2.sh # specific to mahuika and ludovic.dutoit

```

Two samples ,  1.1.2.16 and 3.2.2.27  have absolutely no data after processing, causing the end of the pipeline to crash. We therefore run it manually.

First, we create a new population map without those two samples:

```
grep 1.1.2.16 popmap_all.txt -v  >   popmap_all_nonull.txt
grep 3.2.2.27  popmap_all_nonull.txt -v  >   popmap_all_nonull2.txt
```
We then run the last steps of the pipeline.


```
tsv2bam -P output_M2/ -M popmap_all_nonull2.txt
gstacks -P output_M2 -M popmap_all_nonull2.txt

```


We then run populations, excluding no samples and only the SNPs with more than 65% heterozygosity as likely collapsed paralogs.

```
populations -P output_M2/ -M popmap_all_nonull2.txt  --vcf  --max-het 0.65 # then filter it with 
```
This creates a *source* unfiltered dataset for which we can try different type of filtering.  We are interested in removing low quality individuals ( very few SNPs sequenced) and very low quality SNPs ( very few individuals covered).

The unfiltered dataset is at 
The SNPs are in [output/unfiltered/](output/unfiltered/). 


### Filtering

**Exploration**

I then use a little bit of R code to investigate how much SNps we have across how many individuals?

```
library("VariantAnnotation")
data<-readVcf("populations.snps.vcf")


numbermissing<-function(x){
	return(length(grep("\\./\\.",x)))
}

countsofmissing<-apply(geno(data)$GT,2,numbermissing)
nonmissing<-dim( geno(data)$GT)[1]-countsofmissing
### get list of removals ad then re run as white list with  proportion of missing look
summary(nonmissing)
quantile(nonmissing,seq(0,1,0.05))
#	0%	5%	10%	15%	20%	25%	30%	35%
#	12.0	235.2	478.6	625.6	944.0	1179.0	1571.4	2132.0
#	40%	45%	50%	55%	60%	65%	70%	75%
#	3586.2	5286.2	7602.0	10359.8	13533.0	16869.2	19376.6	23608.0
#	80%	85%	90%	95%	100%
#	28335.2	33788.0	50114.0	71672.4	150823.0

```
Without strong knowledge of the systems and the study goal, it is hard to make a fair call on filtering criteria (i.e. which individuals we will exclude). We do know that we might not need very many SNPs but that large amount of missing data are problematic for many analyses that imputes genotypes in the presence of missing data. (i.e. structure).


I choose to make a dataset where I removed the worse 1/3 of samples, therefore excluding any sample with less than 1919 SNPs:

```
quantile(nonmissing,0.33)
lowest_samples <-names(which(nonmissing<1918.48))# remove the lowest 33%
```

I explore what is left and what do if we remove those in R still.
```
prefilter_gt<-geno(data)$GT # create a genotype matrix
sample_filtered<- prefilter_gt[,-which(colnames(prefilter_gt)%in%lowest_samples)] # remove those samples
propofmissingpersnp<-apply(sample_filtered,1,numbermissing)/dim(sample_filtered)[2] # what is the proportion of missing data snp by snp
length(which(propofmissingpersnp<0.4)) # 60% or more of individuals have data, how many SNP is that?
```

***Removing the 33% individuals with the lowest number of SNPs and then excluding SNP for which less than 60% of individuals have data seem to be a fair call for a filtering step ***

To do so, I create a final popmap without those individuals

```
popmap<-read.table("../popmap_all_nonull2.txt")
new_popmap<-popmap[-which(as.character(popmap[,1])%in%lowest_samples),]
write.table(new_popmap,"../popmap_filtered33percent.txt",sep="\t",row.names=F,col.names=F,quote=F)
```
And finally back in bash I create those SNP files ion the vcf, structure, plink and treemix formats

```
mkdir filtered33percent
populations -P output_M2/ -M popmap_filtered33percent.txt  --vcf --structure --plink --treemix --max-obs-het 0.65 -r 0.6 -O filtered33percent # then filter it with 
```

	
We obtained a final dataset of 319 SNPs for 1857 individuals identified in [popmap_filtered33percent.txt](output/filtered33percent/popmap_filtered33ercent.txt).

The SNPs are in [output/filtered33percent/](output/filtered33percent/)

 Some loci have very many SNPs across their 76bp. I did not exclude them as I know nothing about the genetic diversity of polychaetes:

```
#number of SNPs per loci		1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18
#Numberof loci with n SNPs 		284	165	78	53	28	18	9	10	7	8	4	2	3	3	1	4	1	1
```

** removing 40% of individuals but getting more SNPs**

To show a contrasting pictures, I can retrieve more SNPs by removing 

back into R :
```
library("VariantAnnotation")
data<-readVcf("populations.snps.vcf")


numbermissing<-function(x){
	return(length(grep("\\./\\.",x)))
}

countsofmissing<-apply(geno(data)$GT,2,numbermissing)
nonmissing<-dim( geno(data)$GT)[1]-countsofmissing

hist
quantile(nonmissing,0.4)
    40%
3586.2
lowest_samples <-names(which(nonmissing<3586.2))# remove the lowest 40%

prefilter_gt<-geno(data)$GT # create a genotype matrix
sample_filtered<- prefilter_gt[,-which(colnames(prefilter_gt)%in%lowest_samples)] # remove those samples
propofmissingpersnp<-apply(sample_filtered,1,numbermissing)/dim(sample_filtered)[2] # what is the proportion of missing data snp by snp
length(which(propofmissingpersnp<0.4)) # 60% or more of individuals have data, how many SNP is that?
#[1] 2900
popmap<-read.table("../popmap_all_nonull2.txt")
new_popmap<-popmap[-which(as.character(popmap[,1])%in%lowest_samples),]
write.table(new_popmap,"../popmap_filtered40percent.txt",sep="\t",row.names=F,col.names=F,quote=F)	

### Add a plot for visualisation
png("numberofSNPsperindsbeforefiltering.png")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
 hist(nonmissing, main =" Overall " ,xlab="Number of SNPs", ylab= "Number of individuals",breaks=1000,col="black")
 hist(nonmissing,  main ="Zoomed in" ,xlab="Number of SNPs", ylab= "Number of individuals",breaks=1000,xlim=c(0,10000),col="grey")
 dev.off()
```

Finally we create it using:
```
mkdir filtered40percent
populations -P output_M2/ -M popmap_filtered40percent.txt  --vcf --structure --plink --treemix --max-obs-het 0.65 -r 0.6 -O filtered40percent # then filter it with 
```

We obtained a final dataset of 2829 SNPs for 286 individuals identified in [popmap_filtered40percent.txt](output/filtered40percent/popmap_filtered40percent.txt)

The SNPs are in [output/filtered40percent/](output/filtered40percent/)
